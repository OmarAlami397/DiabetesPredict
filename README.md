# DiabetesPredict

This project is a Diabetes Prediction Model using Random Forest Classification. I decided to do this project to gain more expereince with Machine Learning models and Relational Database management/querying.

I was able to gain plenty of valuable skills and experience in this project including: SQL, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook, and the MySQL Workbench

The original dataset is from the University of California Irvine Machine Learning Repository.

^^^^^ In this website you can find all relevant information about the dataset, such as it's features, preprocessing history, and sources.

I used the dataset with the 50/50 split to ensure there are no errors with the ML model.
